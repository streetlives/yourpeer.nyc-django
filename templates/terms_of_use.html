            <strong>Disclaimers of Warranties. </strong> The Site provided “as
            is” and on an “as available” basis, without warranty or condition of
            any kind, either express or implied. Although Streetlives seeks to
            maintain safe, secure, accurate, and well-functioning services, we
            cannot guarantee the continuous operation of or access to our Site,
            and there may at times be inadvertent technical or factual errors or
            inaccuracies. Streetlives specifically (but without limitation)
            disclaims (i) any implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for
            a particular purpose, quiet enjoyment, or non-infringement; and (ii)
            any warranties arising out of course-of-dealing, usage, or trade.
            You assume all risk for any/all damages that may result from your
            use of or access to the Site. Streetlives does not guarantee the
            accuracy of, and disclaims all liability for, any errors or other
            inaccuracies in the information, content, recommendations, and
            materials made available through the Site.

        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Limitation of Liability. </strong> In no event will
            Streetlives be liable to you for any incidental, special,
            consequential, direct, indirect, or punitive damages, whether based
            on warranty, contract, tort (including negligence), statute, or any
            other legal theory, whether or not Streetlives has been informed of
            the possibility of such damage. Some jurisdictions do not allow the
            disclaimer of warranties or limitation of liability in certain
            circumstances. Accordingly, some of the above limitations may not
            apply to you.

        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Governing Law. </strong> These Terms are governed by the
            laws of the State of New York, without regard to conflict of law
            principles. Subject to Section 11, which provides that disputes are
            to be resolved through binding arbitration or small claims court, to
            the extent that any lawsuit or court proceeding is permitted
            hereunder, you and Streetlives agree to submit to the exclusive
            personal jurisdiction of the state courts and federal courts located
            within New York County, NY for the purpose of litigating all such
            disputes.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Dispute Resolution by Binding Arbitration. </strong> In the
            interest of resolving disputes between you and Streetlives in the
            most expedient and cost-effective manner, you and Streetlives agree
            to resolve disputes through binding arbitration or small claims
            court instead of in courts of general jurisdiction (“Agreement to
            Arbitrate”). Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court.
            Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury,
            allows for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to
            very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same
            damages and relief that a court can award. Any arbitration or
            litigation under these Terms will take place on an individual basis;
            class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted. You
            acknowledge and agree that the arbitrator may award relief
            (including monetary, injunctive, and declaratory relief) only in
            favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent
            necessary to provide relief necessitated by that individual party’s
            claim(s). Any relief awarded cannot affect other users. <br />
