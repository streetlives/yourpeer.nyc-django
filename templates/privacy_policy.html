        This Privacy Policy only applies to information collected on the Site
        and is not intended to fully describe the privacy policies of
        Streetlives. It describes the information that we gather from you, how

          <strong>Personal Information</strong> <br />
          <p>
            Generally, you can visit the Site without telling us who you are or
            revealing any Personal Information (when we use the term “Personal
            Information,” we mean information that can be associated with a
            specific person and can be used to identify that person, such as
            name, e-mail address, mailing address, mobile phone number, age,
            gender, date of birth, as well as additional sensitive information
            such as your social security number, financial information,
            financial account information, and other similar types of
            information). If you do provide us with Personal Information, we
            will store and use that information in accordance with this Policy.
            For example, you may provide us with Personal Information when you
            contact us or request information about us, this Site and our
            products or services (whether by email or other means).

            ability to use the Site or certain features of the Site. We may also

            us analyze how users use the Site.

          <p>
            We may disclose your information if required to do so by law or in
            the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to take
            precautions against liability; to protect Streetlives from
            fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful uses or activity; to protect the
            security or integrity of the Site; to investigate and defend

            divestiture, merger, consolidation, or asset sale, or in the
            unlikely event of a bankruptcy, Streetlives may transfer or assign
            the data, including Personal Information, that we have collected
            from users.

      <h2>Our Commitment to Children’s Privacy:</h2>
      <p>

        Site, we do not knowingly collect or maintain information from persons
        under 13 years of age, and no part of the Site are directed to persons

        take the appropriate steps to delete this information.
      </p>

      <h2>Our Commitment to Data Security:</h2>
      <p>
        We use certain physical, managerial, and technical safeguards that are
        designed to protect the integrity and security of your information;
        however, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable, so we cannot
        ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us
        through the Site, and you do so at your own risk. We also cannot
        guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered,
        or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial
        safeguards. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy
        settings or security measures contained on the Site.
      </p>
      <p>
        We retain information as long as it is reasonably necessary and relevant
        for our operations, and/or to comply with the law, prevent fraud,
        collect any fees owed, resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, assist
        with any investigation, or enforce our Terms or other agreements.

        By accessing this Site and/or providing us with Personal Information and
        other data, you expressly and unconditionally release and hold us
        harmless from any and all liability for any injuries, loss, or damage of

        proper and appropriate use of data by our service providers that may

      <h2>Do Not Track Disclosures:</h2>
      <p>
        Third parties such as advertising networks, analytics providers, and
        widget providers may collect information about your online activities
        over time and across different websites when you access or use our
        Services. Currently, various browsers offer a “Do Not Track” option, but
        there is no standard for how DNT should work on commercial websites. Due
        to lack of such standards, the Site does not respond to Do Not Track
        consumer browser settings.
      </p>
